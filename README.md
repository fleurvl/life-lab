This is my first test at creating my own landing page using the HTML & CSS skills I have acquired in the foundations course of The Odin Project.
I will use flexbox to create a layout mainly inspired by 2 inspiration images given by The Odin Project.
The Life Lab project is a trial for my sister's own business website.
